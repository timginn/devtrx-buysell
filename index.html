				<h2>Tim Ginn</h2><h3>DevTrx #45, 2016-02-13.</h3></section>
				<section>IRC: xtimg in #softwareniagara on freenode</section>
				<section>How did I get started with this?</section>
				<section><img src="o.jpg" alt="Olivia reading JavaScript for Babies Book" style="max-height: 600px;"></section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>May 2014 - bought two sites: <a href="https://flippa.com/3063031-numberproxy-com" target="_blank">NumberProxy</a>, <a href="https://flippa.com/3076581-extremefoodstorage-com" target="_blank">ExtremeFoodStorage</a></li>
						<li>July, 2014 - bought another: AutoWebinarPlayer</li>
						<li>December 2014 - bought <a href="http://wesellyoursite.com/listings/ecommerce/16-year-old-steady-e-commerce-business-bathroom-products/" target="_blank">another ecommerce site</a></li>
						<li>January 2017 - bought <a href="https://flippa.com/7790385-viatexts-com" target="_blank">ViaTexts.com</a></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>How these turned out...</p>
					<ul>
						<li>NumberProxy - great and ongoing, ExtremeFoodStorage - made a small profit but wasn't sustainable</li>
						<li>AutoWebinarPlayer - profitable, but essentially on life support</li>
						<li>ecommerce site - great, main source of income now</li>
						<li>ViaTexts - too early to tell</li>
					</ul>

					Centurica (more on them later) offers a <a href="https://centurica.com/marketwatch" target="_blank">Market Watch</a> that searches multiple brokers/marketplaces.
				</section>
				<section>
					Process (buyers):
					<ul>
						<li>Find a site you're interested in</li>
						<li>Do at least some due diligence upfront (some places let you do conditional offers, others require all due diligence upfront)</li>
						<li>Contact seller and get your questions answered (make sure you have some questions)</li>
						<li>Decide whether or not it's the right site for you, make offer, if accepted pay and receive site.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					Process (sellers):
					<ul>
						<li>Prepare documentation (financials, operating procedures, etc.)</li>
						<li>Write and post a listing</li>
						<li>Answer questions, close deal, collect payment and transfer site.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Pricing</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					Market range: starter sites up to multi-million dollar businesses.
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Generally based on net profit, 2-3 year multiple of net profit EBITA (Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) is common.</p>
					<p>Exceptions exist.</p>
					<p>Higher: long established history, very low time requirements, etc.</p>
					<p>Lower: non-English sites, Canadian / Australian content (or non-UK/EU/USA), declining revenue, etc.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Financing</h1>
					<p>On larger sales ($100,000+) it's relatively common for sellers to offer or be amenable to seller financing.</p>
					<p>On smaller sales, entirely cash is most common/expected.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Time to sell</h1>
					<p>Most sites seem to sell (or be unlisted) within a month or two.</p>
					<p>Some at auction go within a week. Less than that on Flippa doesn't seem ideal.</p>
					<p>I have seen some EmpireFlippers listings sell within hours of their weekly new listing email going out.</p>
					<p>In general, as price goes up, time to sell goes up.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Mitigating Risk</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Beware of fraud/chargebacks <a href="https://empireflippers.com/russian-scammers-vladislav-smolensev-alexandr-smolensev/" target="_blank">How A Russian Syndicate Scammed Us For $25K</a> (Empire Flippers)</li>
						<li>For large dollar amounts, use an escrow service. <a href="http://www.escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a> is common. Typically escrow fees split 50%/50% buyer/seller.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What to Look for?</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Stability and history</li>
						<li>Opportunity for improvement</li>
						<li>Match between site and your skills</li>
						<li>Helpful/prepared seller</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					Past history doesn't guarantee future success; but, it's as good an indicator as you can find.
				</section>

				<section>
					Any improvements you can make will help reduce your payback period.
				</section>

				<section>
					Some sites need specific skills to be successful/thrive. If you don't have them, you'd need to hire for them and account for that.
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>To get the most value out of a sale you need a seller who's prepared and helpful. This helps with a smooth transition and reduces the risk of getting an abandoned site.</p>
					<p>If you're a seller, spend some time on your listing/prospectus and you'll avoid a lot of duplicate questions.</p>
				</section>

					<h2>Types of Buyers</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://empireflippers.com/website-buyers/" target="_blank">6 Types of Website Buyers</a></li>
						<li>Newbie Norms - figuring things out</li>
						<li>DIY David - tinkerer / fixer-upper</li>
						<li>Portfolio Paul - diversification, often time-constrained</li>
						<li>Lifestyle Larry - transitioning from regular job</li>
						<li>Strategic Sally - open to strategic acquisitions</li>
						<li>Flipper Fred - buy, improve, sell</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Gotchas</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					The usual business/investing caveats apply. (Past performance does not guarantee future success).
				</section>
				<section>
					Outright scams do exist.
				</section>
				<section>
					Unprofessional buyers/sellers are common (as are omissions).
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Brokers vary widely in terms of what they do to filter out fraud/scams/errors and omissions.</li>
						<li>You shouldn't trust brokerages to do so anyway (e.g. they represent the seller).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					If I haven't found a problem, I tend to think I'm not looking hard enough...
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Problem: non-unique content</li>
						<li>How to Find It: <a href="http://www.copyscape.com/">Copyscape</a> or similar</li>
						<li>Beware: it won't do images (or, text hidden in minages)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Problem: fake traffic</li>
						<li>How to Find It: Google Analytics, abnormally high bounce rate and/or countries of origin, HTTP referer, etc.</li>
						<li>Beware: Sometimes people are putting hidden iframes in larger sites to inflate numbers</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Problem: doctored revenue screenshots</li>
						<li>How To Find It: Something suspicious in the screenshot, numbers not adding up, date/time on the clock, etc.</li>
						<li>Beware: A live walk through/screenshare is much harder (but not impossible) to fake.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Problem: selling a dream</li>
						<li>How to Find It: "Great potential", etc. (kind of like real estate descriptions of "Handyman's Specials")</li>
						<li>Beware: if it was so easy, they probably would've done it already; things usually aren't as simple as they seem at first</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					PayPal recurring revenue (generally) cannot be transferred.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Due Diligence</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a href="http://www.centurica.com/" target="_blank">Centurica</a> offers a service
				</section>

				<section>
					Verify with analytics, especially third party independent analytics (e.g. Google Analytics is more trustworthy than say server logs)
				</section>

				<section>
					Check the publicly available data that you can:
					<ul>
						<li>whois records - check ownership</li>
						<li>archive.org Wayback Machine - check history</li>
						<li>Netcraft - history</li>
						<li>semrush - keywords, etc.</li>
						<li>server HTTP headers - check for platform, obsolete / vulnerable software</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What to do after acquisition?</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					I like to:
					<ul>
						<li>do any quick wins specific to the site</li>
						<li>Check server error logs (you'd be surprised how often problems exist but are unnoticed)</li>
						<li>check Google Analytics for slow pages</li>
						<li>look at <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> / <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">Pingdom Tools</a> reports and pick off some easy ones</li>
						<li>wait and see how things go for a month or two before making drastic changes</li>
					</ul>
